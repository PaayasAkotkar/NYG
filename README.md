Motivation 🔥: 

               I went through the surgey 😭 had nothing to do 😩 with the life and I was on bed doing nothing 😴
               So I was having too many thoughts 💭 like what if that what if this so I thought what if i guess this rather than think like this
               Than I noiced that the "Guess Games" 🤔 are the future 
               The reason being simple whole family 👪 is include and there's nothing wrong in it and second of all anyone can guess anthing and whats more meaningful and playful is that the
               family is included
               So many guess games are simple and childish you get the hint you guess the word
               or you just fight for who guess most of the words withing time
               To my eye these are all categorized in old fashion model not even retro tho 🥱 
               So I created NYG to add the "Spice" ♨️ in the guessing game 😤
               For more info and motivation make sure to read the broucher
               My main motivation is that to invent a cateogry of guess game in the field of sports by that I mean literally the category that no one would've ever thougt

Whats The Plan Ahead ❓❓❓:

                              I am going to refactor front-end to ReactJs 
                              I guess it would take 7-8 working days 
                              Right now I preferred angular becuase of its robust structure 
                              But I am going to go ReactJS and implmente more complex stuff

Contributors:

              Honestly speaking with you guys is that this project is unotherdox 
              As you will start doing it you'll find that thing stuff is related to our own life
              for exmple; you and your friend having a conversation on some random topic
                          the topic begans on the word [this is what is included in the game called dictionary]
                          from that word you start bringing more names [this is what is included in the game called challenge]
                          the topic ends in by guessing most relvant word [this is what is included in the game guess session]
                          and recursive porcess goes on
