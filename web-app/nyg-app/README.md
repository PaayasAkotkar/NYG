# whats left 🤔:

0. clash mode effect
A.testing ⚙️[its really a pain to find out and do testing using jasmine but i did the most which is required for your better understanding else if you dont understand it
its ok because the whole is tested properly]
B. 👁️ the lobby-component needs a cleaner way tho 
its even harder for me to write so much 
ng-content is provided but yet must still its questionale for memory usage 
C. 😋 looking for more cleaner way of ui 
D. 💃 more animations 
 right now the animations i created feels offset and retro 🧓
